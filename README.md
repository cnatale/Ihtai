### Special Thanks ###

* Hannah Atkinson, for reviewing my code and giving lots of helpful programming advice.
* Chase Rude, Damien Karolev, and Alyssa MacLachlan, who were part of the original project from which this concept evolved.
* My Mom, Dad, sister Liz, her husband Chris who provided advice on mathematical models for biological behavior, brother Jon, and Justin Najar. They all provided support and ideas.
* My wife Bridget, for listening to me ramble on about a.i. theory for months on end while developing this project.
